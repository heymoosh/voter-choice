## Completed

### Phase 0.2 — Write the Phase 2 Spec

- **Commit:** `pending`
- **What was done:** Wrote `docs/PHASE2_SPEC.md` — the multilingual extension spec for Phase 2 (add Spanish language support). Covers: language toggle behavior and placement, what gets translated (all UI text, full AI prompt in Spanish, pre-filled context block, tips, footer, error messages), what does NOT change (logic, data model, existing test IDs), date formatting per language, Spanish reference translations for all error messages, accessibility additions (lang attribute, text expansion), new `data-testid="language-toggle"`, and acceptance criteria. Architecture requirement: adding a third language requires only new translation content, not structural changes.
- **Files created:** `docs/PHASE2_SPEC.md`
- **Issues or deviations:** None

### Phase 0.1 — Write the Feature Spec

- **Commit:** `6718974` — `phase0.1: write feature spec`
- **What was done:** Wrote `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` — the complete feature spec for the ballot research tool. Derived the JSON data schema from `docs/BALLOT_PROMPT.md`. Spec includes: single-page user flow (hero, zip entry, state info display, customized prompt output, tips, footer), full state election data schema with fields for elections, registration deadlines, early voting, voting rules, and resource links. Defined stub data states (TX, CA, NH). Specified all error states, responsive design requirements, accessibility requirements (WCAG AA), and 14 required `data-testid` attributes for the shared Playwright e2e tests.
- **Files created:** `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`
- **Issues or deviations:** None

### Phase 0.0 — Commit planning docs
- **Commit:** `0b163c5` — `phase0: add project config, experiment design, and run log`
