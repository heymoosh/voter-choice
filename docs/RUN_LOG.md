# Run Log

## Next

Begin Phase 0.3b — Measurement automation + branching. Create `npm run measure` script (ESLint, test coverage, complexity, duplication, bundle size, Lighthouse, Playwright e2e). Set up Playwright with shared e2e test suite. Test measure script on scaffold for baseline. Commit, tag as `v0-scaffold`, create all five workflow branches from that tag, push to GitHub. Refer to Phase 0.3b section of `docs/EXPERIMENT_DESIGN.md`.

### Phase 0.3a — Scaffold the Repo

- **Commit:** `b7156af` — `phase0.3a: scaffold repo with Next.js, ESLint, Prettier, and stub data`
- **What was done:** Ran `npx create-next-app@15.2.4` (then upgraded Next.js to 15.5.12 to resolve security vulnerabilities — 0 audit issues). Configured ESLint with `eslint-plugin-complexity` (max 10) and Prettier integration via `eslint-config-prettier` + `eslint-plugin-prettier`. Pinned all dependencies to exact versions. Added `.nvmrc` (Node 22.14.0) and `engines` field in `package.json`. Created stub JSON data for TX, CA, NH with varied election rules (open/semi-closed/semi-open primaries, different ID and phone policies, same-day registration variations). Created `zip-to-state.json` mapping with sample zip codes including a multi-state entry (86515 → AZ/NM). Generated `docs/QUALITATIVE_SCORECARD.md` template with pre-run and post-run sections for all 5 runs (workflow names TBD in Phase 0.5).
- **Files created:** `.nvmrc`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`, `package.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `src/data/states/TX.json`, `src/data/states/CA.json`, `src/data/states/NH.json`, `src/data/zip-to-state.json`, `docs/QUALITATIVE_SCORECARD.md`, plus Next.js scaffold files (`src/app/`, `public/`)
- **Issues or deviations:** `create-next-app` required temporarily moving `.claude/` and `docs/` out of the way (it refuses to run in a directory with existing files). Next.js 15.2.4 had critical security advisories; upgraded to 15.5.12 (same major version, no API changes). `next lint` shows deprecation warning for Next.js 16 — not actionable now, all branches will have the same behavior.

### Phase 0.2 — Write the Phase 2 Spec

- **Commit:** `1049f0e` — `phase0.2: write Phase 2 spec (multilingual extension)`
- **What was done:** Wrote `docs/PHASE2_SPEC.md` — the multilingual extension spec for Phase 2 (add Spanish language support). Covers: language toggle behavior and placement, what gets translated (all UI text, full AI prompt in Spanish, pre-filled context block, tips, footer, error messages), what does NOT change (logic, data model, existing test IDs), date formatting per language, Spanish reference translations for all error messages, accessibility additions (lang attribute, text expansion), new `data-testid="language-toggle"`, and acceptance criteria. Architecture requirement: adding a third language requires only new translation content, not structural changes.
- **Files created:** `docs/PHASE2_SPEC.md`
- **Issues or deviations:** None

### Phase 0.1 — Write the Feature Spec

- **Commit:** `6718974` — `phase0.1: write feature spec`
- **What was done:** Wrote `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` — the complete feature spec for the ballot research tool. Derived the JSON data schema from `docs/BALLOT_PROMPT.md`. Spec includes: single-page user flow (hero, zip entry, state info display, customized prompt output, tips, footer), full state election data schema with fields for elections, registration deadlines, early voting, voting rules, and resource links. Defined stub data states (TX, CA, NH). Specified all error states, responsive design requirements, accessibility requirements (WCAG AA), and 14 required `data-testid` attributes for the shared Playwright e2e tests.
- **Files created:** `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`
- **Issues or deviations:** None

### Phase 0.0 — Commit planning docs

- **Commit:** `0b163c5` — `phase0: add project config, experiment design, and run log`
- **What:** Committed docs/, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, .claude/ to git
