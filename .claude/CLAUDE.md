# CLAUDE.md

## Project

Workflow experiment comparing 5 AI coding frameworks. Read `docs/RUN_LOG.md` first (the `## Next` line), then `docs/EXPERIMENT_DESIGN.md` Session Quick Start. Immediately execute the sub-phase described in `## Next` — do NOT pause or wait for confirmation. Do ONE sub-phase per session.

**After completing a sub-phase, you MUST update `docs/RUN_LOG.md` before doing anything else:**

1. Move the completed phase from `## Next` into `## Completed` (include commit hash and brief summary).
2. Write the new next phase into `## Next`.
3. Commit the RUN_LOG update. The session is NOT complete until RUN_LOG reflects the new state.

## Boundaries

- **Repo only.** Never read/write/delete anything outside `/Users/Muxin/Documents/GitHub/voter-choice`
- **No sudo.** No global installs (`npm -g`, system pip). Local `npm install` is fine; pip must use a venv
- **No force push, no branch deletion, no history rewriting** (rebase, reset --hard, amend pushed commits). Branches and tags are experiment data.
- **Commit before switching branches.** Pull before pushing.
- **No privileged Docker containers.** Bind ports to 127.0.0.1 only.
- **`rm -rf` only on build artifacts** (node_modules, .next, coverage, dist) with exact paths. State what you're deleting before running.
- Pin exact versions in package.json. Meaningful commit messages: `phase0.1: write feature spec`
- If anything requires going outside these boundaries, **stop and ask Muxin.**

## Code Style

TypeScript. ESLint + Prettier (configured in Phase 0.3a as part of scaffold setup).
